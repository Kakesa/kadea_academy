        <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>
        <h2>Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family’s farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the “National Youth Administration”</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money, Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them," he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enlist in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack but is rejected. He becomes a research assistant at the University of Minnesota.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Joins the Mexican Agricultural Program to improve food production. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he learns about breeding pest-resistant plants.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Rejects a job away from DeKalb, wed his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on earth.</li>
            <li><strong>1948</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf wheat for disease resistant bread, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico’s wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we learned about science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
            <p>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</p>
